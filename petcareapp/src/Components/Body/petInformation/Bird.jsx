                            <h4>Cause</h4>
                            <p> - Due to the temperature difference, the daytime temperature is usually quite high, 
                                but it turns cold at night. Pet birds are often less active, 
                                so their resistance will be weaker, more susceptible to colds and flu. </p>
                            
                          
                            <h4>Symptom</h4>
                            <p> - Fur ruffled, tattered, less active in flight, wheezing, weak appetite, runny nose, 
                                sometimes trembling, lethargic eyes. </p>

                            <h4>Treatment</h4>
                            <p> - When discovered, it is necessary to carefully check the condition. 
                                If the bird has not ruffled its feathers and still combs its feathers normally, it means that the 
                                disease is not very serious. Move the bird cage to a warm, airtight, well-lit place, the temperature 
                                maintained at about 25Â°C. Use a cotton swab to wipe away the snot to help them breathe easier. For 
                                critically ill birds, use the antibiotic Chlortetracycline. Crush and mix into food, feed 2 times a day, 
                                treat for 3 days. If the bird does not feed on its own, mix it in drinking water and pump it slowly into its 
                                mouth to avoid choking. For large birds, most of them can clear up on their own without the need for medication. 
                                You can bake bananas and pepper to feed the birds. This will help them build their own resistance. </p>
                            
                            <h4>Prevention</h4>
                            <p> - When buying new birds, it is necessary to mix antibiotics into the bird's food and water to kill pathogens. 
                                Supplement with nutrients that support the immune system such as: egg yolk, fish meal, canola oil. 
                                When the weather turns cold, the cage must be moved to a place that is airtight, with lots of light and warmth. </p>

                            <h4>Treatment</h4>
                            <p> - Give birds 1-2 mg of Ampicillin; 15ml water with 25% sugar. Feed the bird continuously for 3 days. </p>
                            
                            <h4>Prevention</h4>
                            <p> - The cage must be cleaned regularly. Do not change the bird's food often, do not feed the bird with a lot of water, about once a week, or eat on a hot day. </p>

                                Birds drink a lot of water leading to diarrhea, after the disease worsens, 
                                the stools are red-brown and mixed with fresh blood. </p>

                            <h4>Treatment</h4>
                            <p> - Coccidiosis is a very common disease in poultry, so there are many drugs of many different brands both domestically and internationally. After detecting the disease, you should go to the nearest veterinary 
                                medicine facility for advice and instructions on how to use it. Or buy imported drugs like Endocox 2.5%, 
                                Baycox 2.5%, Cocci-Care... </p>
                            
                            <h4>Prevention</h4>
                            <p> - Pathogens in feces can survive independently waiting for the opportunity to infect other birds. 
                                Therefore, it is necessary to clean the cages and take measures 
                                to disinfect and disinfect and use preventive drugs periodically to avoid cross-contamination in the herd.</p>
